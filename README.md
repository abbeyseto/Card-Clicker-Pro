# Card-Clicker-Pro

A simple game that explores interaction between user and the DOM using code organization techniques. Objects and their values are manipulated and users click to update the html elements.

## Interaction
* When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area updates to show the data for the selected cat.
* The number of clicks in the cat area are unique to each cat, and increments when the cat's picture is clicked.
* When the admin button is clicked, the admin area appears with the inputs filled in for the currently-selected cat.
* When the cancel button in the admin area is pressed, the admin area disappears.
* When the save button in the admin area is pressed, the currently-selected cat's values update with the values in the admin area, and the admin area disappears.
